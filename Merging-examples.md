# Reverts

- I experimented (Mar/Apr '23) with how to use `git revert` to get round merge conflicts. 
    - This was while I was thinking about the "shiny happy example" in my O'Reilly TBD article
- Details...
- On my machine:
    - In commit c537fd2... I moved functions around
    - In commit 3b1ba18... I changed a return value
- Remotely (directly in github.com):
    - In commit beecdf3f I changed a return value in a different function
    - In commit 656cb14 I added a member var to the class, then updated it in the function whose return value was changed locally
- Back on my machine:
    - I ran my `gup` alias, which actually runs `git pull --rebase`, which will `fetch` AND `merge` (via `pull`) AND `rebase`
    - There was a merge conflict
    - I abandoned the merge: `git rebase --abort`
    - I reverted the two local commits from before, in reverse order (3b1ba18, c537fd2)
    - I did another `gup` (pull, merge, rebase)
    - This time I skipped all the merge conflicts (four this time - both the original commits and the reverts of those commits
        - I tried `git cherry-pick` on the original commits, but of course that didnâ€™t work because of the same problems - merge confiicts
        - !! Because I skipped the merge conflicts this also means the original commits AND their reverts were all LOST from the timeline - the commits are no longer visible in the branch, either locally or remotely, not even if you add the commit ID to a relevant url
    - So I used `git reflog` to see the orignal commit IDs
    - Then `git diff [commit id] [commit id]` to see the changes introduced by those commits
    - Then manually made same changes again
    - Then pushed the result
- Replay:
    - On my machine:
        - In commit 1210454 we moved functions around
        - In commit d7bd32d we changed a return value
    - Remotely:
        - In commit 176eb2c they changed a return value in a different function
        - In commit 37ca315 they removed the member var update line from the function whose return value was changed locally
    - Back on my machine:
        - I did another `gup` (pull, merge, rebase)
